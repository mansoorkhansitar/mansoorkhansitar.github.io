Welcome to my personal site! I am Mansoor Rahimat Khan, a musician/engineer/researcher/composer/data scientist/technologist/AI educator originally from Goa, India. Iâ€™m an electronics and communication major from National Institute of Technology Goa, India. Ever since I first learned digital signal processing while taking a signal processing course I was curious to know more about audio signal processing, I have pursued music as a passion, and as a career I have always dreamt of pursuing my research in a field that combines music and technology.

I am interested in machine learning and using it for the purpose of understanding sound and music technology. I am always looking for opportunities and projects where I can contribute my music knowledge and always willing to learn about new discoveries in the field of Deep Learning. I believe music has the power to unite communities irrespective of race/caste/religion/geographies and it is very important to understand what it is about music that makes this possible.

Since the time I graduated from NIT in 2015, I have worked in various fields spanning from financial markets, music, software development to AI education. I have tried and made the best of my early 20s by investing more time into exploring the different fields that are out there rather than settling into one at an early stage of my career. I attended grad school at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta for their Masters in Music Technology program in Fall 2018, however, I had to leave my program in the midst of my first semester due to financial crisis in my family and lack of funding opportunities in the graduate program.

In 2015, I completed my undergraduate education in the field of Electronics and Communication with an experience of 3 internships, the most significant one being at IITB, where I worked under Prof. Preeti Rao in a project for understanding the characteristics of sound of the instrument sitar, the instrument I play and that is a part of my family tradition. Ever since, I did my final year project theses in the same area and graduated with a CGPA of 8.06/10 .

I worked initially as a Global Derivatives Trader trading the Eurodollar short term interest rates futures markets, I grossed 20000 USD for my company in profits. However, I realized the trading floor wasn't a place I imagined would lead to fulfillment of my dreams. 

I began my stint of an independent musician in 2017 and worked on my youtube channel, founded my own music events company and gave around 100 concerts across India as a independent artist/ sitar player. This was the period I understood music at a good depth and also explored different forms of music such as Indian Classical, Jazz, Fusion, Pop, Electronic music etc. I continued this journey till the Fall of 2018 before I left for the US to pursue my masters. 

Upon returning from Atlanta, I arrived in Bangalore to join a music technology startup, a dream job for me where I was able to contribute both my skills in music and machine learning and worked there for 1.5 year. However, due to the focused nature of the startup we lost out on funding and I had to look for other fulfilling opportunities in Bangalore and that drove me to the field of education in AI. Ever since I have been working at one of India's top ed-tech startup and contributing to building top quality content in the field of Deep Learning.

My other interests include cooking, reading on geopolitics, understanding cultures and travel.
