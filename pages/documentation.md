I was born in a family of Indian classical sitar players that was instrumental in the development, design and playing of the instrument sitar. My great grandfather Sitar Ratna Rahimat Khan was the inventor of the Kharaj Pancham(7 stringed) sitar which was popularised world over by Pt. Ravi Shankar.

Originally a family from North India, Rahimat Khan (1863-1954) was born to Ghulam Hussain Khan - a great vocalist in the court of Bhavanagar. His grandfather Madaar Baksh was a famous singer and sitar player in the court of Ratlam. Young Rahimat trained under his father and grandfather and later under the legendary beenkar Bande Ali Khan. Being a contemporary of Bhatkande and Paluskar he was very fond of their idea of conceptualizing, preserving and making raga-sangeet available to the masses. In his lifetime Rahimat Khan founded eight music schools where he was teaching alongside great musicians like vocalist Baskharbuwa Bakhale among others. In 1912 he settled in Dharwad and continued to perform and teach music till the end of his life. Rahimat Khan is also credited with adding the kharaj-shadaj string (the very low SA) to the sitar - thus inventing the kharaj-pancham-string setup that is widely used nowadays. In three of his six (Malkauns, Jaunpuri and Jogiya) 78rpm recordings he is utilizing the Kharaj Sa string for brief passages during alap. His son Abdul Karim Khan passed on his legacy  to his sons: Usman Khan, Bale Khan ( died 2007), Mehboob Khan (died 2015), Hameed Khan, Chote Rahimat Khan, Rafique Khan and Shafique Khan.



 Rahimat Khan's (1863-1954) addition of Kharaj Shadaj string. The absence of Kharaj Shadaj hampered alaap in vilambIt. And alaap, jad, badhat, jhala played on the Been were not possible in the earlier Sitar. Rahimat Khan's innovative mind not only added the Kharaj Shada! string but also rearranged the strings. This resulted in increased melody. flexibility and variety.
